# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

The Election Analysis Project aims to showcase the election auditing process for the Colorado congressional districts. Tom and Seth have asked an aspiring data analyst to 
help find the total votes, candidates, candidate votes, and the winner of the election. Here is an outline of the auditing process:

1. Calculating the total number of votes casted in the Arapahoe, Jefferson and Denver counties.
2. Evaluating a list of unique candidates that received votes.
3. Tabulating the total number of votes for each candidate.
4. Finding vote percentage of each candidate.
5. Determining the majority winner candidate and displaying the winning vote count and winning vote percentage.
